1. I would describe that guy of not actually having his own taste, and that they are listening to only popular songs meaning either they are
exploring all the popular songs, or they just don't care much about music and listen to most popular songs so they don't have to worry about
finding music that they like.

2. I think one crucial missing factor is repeatability, how many times has the user looped, played back the song and for how long? Some songs are
trendy at first, but people get bored of it and some songs always stay popular, they are the best ones which I dont see how is measured using
existing formula. Also likeability of a song, the song being good is important as sometimes artist's hype can overshadow the ratings and hide
the true nature and performance of a song, sure it might be initially popular, but will it be popular in the future once the trend is gone?
